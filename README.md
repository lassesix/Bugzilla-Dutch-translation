# Bugzilla-Dutch-translation
This is a partial translation of Bugzilla 5.0.3 to Dutch (Nederlands).
The focus of this translation is the user facing part of the interface.

Note that you should probably replace the name used for "bugs" in global/variables.none.tmpl .
In our system we use the term "PVK" (Probleem, Verbetervoorstel, Klacht) instead of "bug".

Feel free to contribute by submitting your improvements through Github!
